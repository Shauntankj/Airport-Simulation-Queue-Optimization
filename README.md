# Airport-Simulation-Queue-Optimization

●	Developed an airport simulation to track passenger flow and runway operations.
●	Analysed queue lengths & moving averages at gates, optimizing boarding & resource allocation.
●	Conducted sensitivity analysis on airplane distribution (5 to 50 minutes) & queue capacities (10 to 40 units), impacting average queue lengths by up to 6 passengers.
●	Visualized CDFs & trends to identify bottlenecks, improving passenger flow & boarding efficiency.
